# What is the most common that a data intensive application should have (according to the book)?

- Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)
- Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
- Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)
- Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream pro‐
cessing)
- Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)

# what is MTTF?
- The MTTF is the average time an item will run before it fails. It is the average life of the element. With censored data, the arithmetic average of the data does not provide an adequate measure of the center, because at least some of the failure times are unknown.

# What are the three concerns that are important in most software systems(according to the book)?
- Reliability
	The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at
	the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or soft‐
	ware faults, and even human error). 

- Scalability
As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should
be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.

- Maintainability
	Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and oper‐
	ations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use
	cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.

# What is a sandbox environment?
- A sandbox is a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and outright experimentation from the production environment or repository, in the context of software development including Web development and revision control.

# What is software telemetry for?
- In software, telemetry is used to gather data on the use and performance of applications and application components, e.g. how often certain features are used, measurements of start-up time and processing time, hardware, application crashes, and general usage statistics and/or user behavior.

# What is a head-of-line blocking?
- Line header blocking on computer networks is a phenomenon that limits the performance that occurs when the first packet retains a line of packets. Examples include buffered network switches, out-of-order delivery, and multiple requests in HTTP pipeline.

#What is a legacy system?
- A legacy system is a computer system that has become outdated but continues to be used by the user and is not wanted or cannot be easily replaced or upgraded.
