# Database oriented to documents
A document database is a type of non-relational database that has been designed to store and query data as JSON type documents. 
Document databases make it easy for developers to store and query data in a database using the same document model format that 
they use in application code. The flexible, semi-structured and hierarchical nature of documents and document databases allows 
them to evolve according to the needs of the applications. The document model works well with use cases such as catalogs, user profiles, 
and content management systems where each document is unique and evolves over time. Document databases allow easy indexing, powerful 
ad hoc queries, and analysis of document collections. Documentary databases are fundamental allies that we can trust for the handling 
of voluminous amounts of information.
